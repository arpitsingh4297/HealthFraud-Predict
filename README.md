# HealthFraud Predict

HealthFraud Predict is a machine learning-based application designed to detect potential fraud by healthcare providers. Using a Naive Bayes model trained on healthcare provider data, the app predicts whether a provider is "Fraudulent" or "Non-Fraudulent" based on input features such as average claim amount, number of claims, and patient demographics. The user-friendly Streamlit interface allows users to input provider details and receive a prediction with the probability of fraud.
Features

Fraud Prediction: Predicts provider fraud using a tuned Naive Bayes model (Test F1-Score: 0.605).
Input Features: Supports five key features:
Average Patient Age (years, range: ~33–99)
Number of Claims per Provider (range: ~1–8240)
Average Claim Amount ($USD, range: ~3377–57000)
Chronic Condition Score (range: ~12–22)
Total Claim Amount Reimbursed ($USD, range: ~207970–5996050)


Streamlit Interface: Easy-to-use web app for entering provider details and viewing predictions.
Key Insights:
Fraudulent providers typically have higher claim amounts and more frequent claims.
Older patients are more associated with fraudulent providers.



Installation
To set up HealthFraud Predict locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HealthFraud-Predict.git
cd HealthFraud-Predict


Install Python:Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Download from python.org.

Install Dependencies:Install required Python packages using pip:
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib


Verify Model Files:Ensure the following files are in the project directory:

best_fraud_detection_model.joblib: Trained Naive Bayes model.
selected_features.json: List of features used by the model.These files are generated by the training script or should be provided with the repository.



Usage

Run the Streamlit App:Start the Streamlit server from the project directory:
streamlit run app.py

Open the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

Enter Provider Details:Input values for the five features in the web interface. Example:

Average Patient Age: 73
Number of Claims per Provider: 100
Average Claim Amount: 5000
Chronic Condition Score: 5
Total Claim Amount Reimbursed: 500000Use the suggested ranges (displayed in the app) for realistic inputs.


View Prediction:Click "Predict" to see the result, e.g.:

Prediction: Non-Fraudulent
Probability of Fraud: 0.0000



Project Structure

app.py: Main Streamlit application for fraud prediction.
best_fraud_detection_model.joblib: Trained GaussianNB model file.
selected_features.json: JSON file listing the five features used (Age, Claims_Per_Provider, Avg_Claim_Amt, Chronic_Score, InscClaimAmtReimbursed).
README.md: This file, providing project documentation.

Model Details

Model: NaiveBayes_Original_Tuned (GaussianNB, var_smoothing=1e-06)
Performance: Test F1-Score of 0.605 on the test set.
Features:
Age: Average patient age in years.
Claims_Per_Provider: Number of claims submitted by the provider.
Avg_Claim_Amt: Average dollar amount per claim.
Chronic_Score: Score reflecting prevalence of chronic conditions.
InscClaimAmtReimbursed: Total dollar amount reimbursed for claims.


Data Source: Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection Dataset
Training Insights:
Fraudulent providers often have higher Avg_Claim_Amt and Claims_Per_Provider.
Higher Age correlates with fraud due to older patients’ association with fraudulent claims.
